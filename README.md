## Project Overview

**MusicianAssistant** is a cross-platform mobile application (Android & iOS) built with .NET MAUI, designed to help musicians, artists, and bands efficiently manage their song notes and multiple versions of their compositions. The app allows users to keep track of different arrangements and versions of songs, and will support attaching related materials such as PDFs and videos for easy access.

A key feature under development is the integration of an AI-powered image processing service. This will enable users to take a photo of handwritten sheet music or song notes, and have it automatically converted into a clean, readable digital format â€” saving time and simplifying the process of digital transcription.

The application connects to a .NET Web API backend, enabling bands and artists to centralize their data in the cloud for easy editing and access across multiple devices. Supabase is currently being used for authentication and will also serve as the storage solution for PDFs, videos, and other media files. For AI image processing, a dedicated microservice (planned to be developed in Python) will handle image uploads, process them in the cloud, and return a digital-friendly version of the content.

MusicianAssistant is currently in active development, with a vision to become an essential companion for musicians seeking to digitize and organize their creative work seamlessly.
